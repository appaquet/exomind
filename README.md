**Warning: Exomind is a personal project. I daily drive it, but it may not be stable for your use case.**

Exomind is a personal knowledge management tool that serves as a unified inbox.
It allows you to manage your emails, notes, tasks, and bookmarks, organizing them into collections.

It is built on top of [Exocore](./exocore/), a distributed application framework, and is meant to be
hosted in a decentralized fashion on user's selected servers (ex: Raspberry Pi, VPS, etc.).

## Quick Start

To get started with Exomind, follow the quick start guides in the following order:

1. **Exocore Quick Start**: Set up the underlying Exocore framework by following the instructions in [Exocore's README](./exocore/README.md).
2. **Exomind Quick Start**: Once Exocore is set up, follow the instructions in [Exomind's README](./exomind/README.md) to install and run Exomind.
