**Warning: Exomind is mostly a personal project. I daily drive it, but it may not be stable for your use case**

Exomind is a personal knowledge management tool. It is a unified inbox in which your emails, your notes, your tasks and your bookmarks can live
and be organized in collections.

It is built on top of [Exocore](./exocore/), a distributed application framework, and is meant to be
hosted in a decentralized fashion on user's selected servers (ex: Raspberry Pi, VPS, etc.).

## Usage

* See [exocore's README](./exocore/README.md)
* See [exomind's README](./exomind/README.md)
